Custom JWT Authentication

The keys in this folder "test/data/jwt_keys" are used only for the purpose of the automatic tests.
They are not needed in production.
The tests that requires these files are related to testing login user to Atlas App using JWT token issued by a custom token provider. For more information read [Custom JWT Authentication](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/).
For the purpose of the tests the token is generated by the JWT tests. These custom tokens are using RSA algorithm and key pair of private (private.pem) and public (public.pem) keys.

* How generate files:

    Both files (private.pem and public public.pem) are generated with `openssl` command https://www.openssl.org/

    * Download `openssl.exe`

    * Generate private key for singing tokens with command: `openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048`

    * Generate publik key for validating tokens with command: `openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem`

    * Generate jwks.json using some generator. For example: https://russelldavies.github.io/jwk-creator/
Only public key should be included in jwk. Required Key ID (kid) is "1".

The tests supports two Verification Methods:
[Manually Specify Signing Keys](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#manually-specify-signing-keys)
and [Use a JWK URI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#use-a-jwk-uri)

For testing verification method "Manually Specify Signing Keys" public and private keys are enough. Public key is automatically set to the clout app.
For testing verification method "Use a JWK URI" you need to generate jwks.json.
